Information about argus-pep-common
----------------------------------

This package was debianized using the mh_make command
from the maven-debian-helper package.

The build system uses Maven but prevents it from downloading
anything from the Internet, making the build compliant with
the Debian policy.

The original sources were obtained with the following command:

./orig-tar.sh 2.2.0

The ARGUS framework is a collection of Java software built with
maven. The upstream maintainers decided to list all of the project's
dependencies in a single POM. This parent is required to build each
and every component of the ARGUS framework.

For Debian this would lead to a single argus-parent package which is
just a single pom.xml file, that all of the other ARGUS components
would depend on. Instead, I've decided to include the parent for each
component, following some hints by Ludovic Claude. This means that
this package builds from two source tarballs:

 - the parent is placed in the orig.tar.gz tarball, while 
 - the pep-common component is in ...orig-pep-common.tar.gz.

Dpkg-sources knows what to do with this.
